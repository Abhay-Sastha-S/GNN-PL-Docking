# Proposal: Dynamic Interaction Graph Neural Networks (DI-GNN) for Protein-Ligand Docking

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Background
Protein–ligand docking is a fundamental problem in computational drug discovery, where the goal is to predict the most stable binding configuration of a small molecule (ligand) to a target protein. Traditional docking methods rely on empirical scoring functions and brute-force search strategies, often leading to high computational costs and limited accuracy in capturing molecular flexibility.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently emerged as a powerful tool for molecular modeling, but existing GNN-based docking models still struggle with pose optimization, interaction modeling, and generalization to unseen proteins. In this project, we propose **Dynamic Interaction Graph Neural Networks (DI-GNN)**, a novel AI-driven approach that introduces dynamic graph representations, reinforcement learning-based pose refinement, and physics-aware energy modeling to significantly enhance docking accuracy and efficiency.

## 2. Motivation and Research Interest

Understanding and predicting molecular interactions is one of the most crucial challenges in computational biology and artificial intelligence. My passion for AI-driven drug discovery stems from the potential impact it has on accelerating the development of novel therapeutics. By combining expertise in computer science and deep learning with an interest in bioinformatics, I aim to develop a system that can transform the way protein–ligand interactions are predicted.

This research aligns with the growing interest in AI-driven drug design and has the potential to:
- Reduce drug development costs and timelines.
- Bridge the gap between deep learning and molecular docking.
- Push the boundaries of computational biology and AI applications in drug discovery.

## 3. Proposed System: DI-GNN Architecture

The **Dynamic Interaction Graph Neural Network (DI-GNN)** improves upon existing methods through the following innovations:

- **Dynamic Graph Representations:**  
  DI-GNN updates the interaction graph as docking progresses, capturing both local and global flexibility of protein–ligand binding.

- **Graph Attention Networks:**  
  It prioritizes important molecular interactions by dynamically adjusting edge weights based on learned importance scores.

- **Physics-Guided Energy Features:**  
  The model integrates hydrogen bonding, electrostatics, and van der Waals forces into GNN edge attributes for more accurate binding affinity prediction.

- **Reinforcement Learning (RL) for Pose Refinement:**  
  Instead of relying on a single predicted pose, DI-GNN employs RL-based optimization to iteratively refine ligand positions toward the most stable conformation.

- **Contrastive Learning for Generalization:**  
  The approach trains on both positive (correct binding poses) and negative (incorrect docking poses) examples, enhancing its ability to generalize to unseen protein-ligand pairs.

### 3.1 System Workflow

1. **Graph Construction:**  
   Convert a protein–ligand structure into a molecular graph with nodes (atoms) and edges (interatomic interactions).

2. **Initial Pose Prediction:**  
   Use a GNN-based model to predict an initial ligand pose.

3. **Pose Refinement (RL-Guided Optimization):**  
   Refine the ligand’s position using reinforcement learning, optimizing docking scores in real time.

4. **Binding Affinity Estimation:**  
   Use a hybrid machine learning–energy function to evaluate docking stability.

5. **Final Docking Pose Selection:**  
   Choose the most stable ligand conformation based on learned interaction patterns.
